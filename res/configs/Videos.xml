  - \brief  Here are listed some informations needed by the videos module

            It's possible to simultaneously capture from several video devices.

            Note that this latter is also built as a dynamic library to make it
            usable alone in order to control video devices.

      General

      - priority     : Internal threads' priority
                       0 <=> Lowest
                       1 <=> Default
                       2 <=> Highest

      - configChoice : Config from which retrieve v4l2 parameters
                       (Cf. control/configs/VideoConfig.c to add more configs)
                       0 <=> MJPEG (MMAP)
                       1 <=> MJPEG (USERPTR)
                       2 <=> YVYU  (MMAP)
                       3 <=> YVYU  (USERPTR)

      - gfxDest      : Name of graphics element where captured video frames are drawn.
                       Attention ! Make sure that element is defined in Graphics.xml

      - serverDest   : Name of server used to stream captured video frames.
                       Attention ! Make sure that server is defined in Servers.xml

      Note : Obviously, gfxDest and serverDest are only used if the related modules are enabled
             (see Main.xml)

    <!--
      Device

      - name : Unique name of this video device (Define what you want)

      - src  : Path to video device to use

      - width / height : Device's resolution. If not supported, the closest one should be used instead
                         by the driver
    -->
    <Device name="camera0" src="/dev/video0" width="640" height="480" />

    <!--
      Output

        - width / height : Captured video signal is rendered in a surface having these dimensions
    -->
    <Output width="640" height="480" />

    <!--
      Buffer

      - nbBuffers  : Provided to v4l2 when requesting buffers

      - desiredFps : Used to set the number of frames to get per second
                     The provided value needs to be supported by the driver otherwise it won't be
                     taken into account.
