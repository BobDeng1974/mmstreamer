    General
    
    - appDataDir      : Files created at runtime are stored here (screenshots, ...)
    
    - xmlRootDir      : Concatenated to xmlFile to get the real path to configuration files
    
    - keepAliveMethod : Method to use to keep the application running
                        0 => Events_based    : It can be used when keyEvents are handled by graphics module
                        1 => Semaphore_based : It can be used when you want to handle keyEvents differently.
                                               To avoid infinite loop, you have to call "sem_post()" when app
                                               needs to be stopped
                        2 => Timer_based     : It can be used when you want to run the application in a limited
                                               time
                        
                                               Note: Attribute timeout_s="<value in seconds>" is ignored if
                                               method is not Timer_based.
