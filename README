1- Description

mmstreamer is a media streamer entirely written in C and made for the linux operating
system.

It currently comes with 4 independant modules :

- Video    : Capture frames from video devices
- Servers  : Stream frames using unix or inet socket
- Clients  : Get video stream from local or remote streamer
- Graphics : Locally display video

A simple usage of mmstreamer is to make it behave like a HTTP streamer by streaming
video frames from your personal computer's webcam toward browsers.

To reach this goal, "Video" module continuously captures frames from camera which it
can locally display using "Graphics" module  before they are sent to connected clients
through "Servers" module.

All kind of clients are supported : Browsers, Applications (VLC, ...)
Connections can also be performed from any type of devices (computers, mobiles).

mmstreamer provides a dynamic library called "libnet-client-<version>.so" that can be
used to connect and get stream from its servers. However, feel free to implement your
own client.

Finally, note that mmstreamer can have different other usages. Your mind is its only
limit. For example, by enabling "Clients" and "Graphics" / "Servers" modules ("Video"
disabled), it is possible to get video from a remote streamer (E.g. vlc - See below)
and display it locally and/or stream it over a another network interface.

 cvlc v4l2:///dev/video0:chroma=mjpg:width=640:height=480 --sout '#std{access=http{mime
 =multipart/x-mixed-replace;boundary=--7b3cc56e5f51db803f790dad720ed50a},mux=mpjpeg,dst
 =127.0.0.1:8090}'

2- Goal

The initial purpose of mmstreamer project was to help me have a better understanding
of v4l2 API. It was only composed of one .c file which captured video signal from my
personal webcam and made it available to HTTP clients.

Because I think it can be useful to many people, I will make mmstreamer evolve by 
gradually adding new features taking advantage of possibilities offered by v4l2 API:

- Add support of TV tuners
- Allow to simultaneously capture from several video devices
- Add encryption to secure the data before transmission
- ...

3- License

mmstreamer is distributed under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (GPL) version 3 or later.
Please, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/> for more details.

4- Maintenance and support

I do all this on my free time without being paid or asking for any donations. Thus, bug
fixing and updates mainly depend on my availibility.

However, I will soon try to write and provide all necessary documentation so as to make
mmstreamer easier to understand.
