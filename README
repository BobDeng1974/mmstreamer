0- Where to begin

- INSTALL : Prepare your environment and build mmstreamer project
- HOWTO   : Run mmstreamer + update configuration files

1- Description

mmstreamer is a v4l2-based media streamer entirely written in C and made for the linux
operating system. It aims to be an easy-to-use application that can be customized to
suit your needs.

mmstreamer currently includes 4 independent modules :

  - Videos   : To capture frames from video devices
  - Servers  : To stream frames using unix or inet socket
  - Clients  : To get video stream from local or remote streamer
  - Graphics : To locally display video

The application has been designed to make configuring these features as simple as
possible. Unless you have very specific needs, the following xml resources should
be sufficient to use it :

  - res/Main.xml             : Choose which modules to launch and how to keep app alive
  - res/configs/Videos.xml   : Configure video devices and outputs
  - res/configs/Servers.xml  : Configure servers
  - res/configs/Clients.xml  : Configure clients
  - res/configs/Graphics.xml : Customize UI and locally display captured video
                               Note : Graphic elements can be added using <Element> tag

  - res/common/Colors.xml    : Define colors
  - res/common/Fonts.xml     : List fonts files
  - res/common/Images.xml    : List images files
  - res/common/Strings.xml   : Define strings

A simple usage of mmstreamer is to make it behave like a HTTP streamer by streaming
video signal from your personal computer's webcam toward browsers.

To reach this goal, "Videos" module continuously captures frames from camera which it
can locally display using "Graphics" module  before they are sent to connected clients
through "Servers" module.

All kind of clients are supported : Browsers, Applications (VLC, ...)
Connections can also be initiated from any type of devices (computers, mobiles).

mmstreamer provides a dynamic library called "libnet-client-<version>.so" that can be
used to connect and get stream from its servers. However, feel free to implement your
own client.

Finally, note that mmstreamer can have different other usages. Your mind is its only
limit. For example, by enabling "Clients" and "Graphics" / "Servers" modules ("Videos"
disabled), it is possible to get video from a remote streamer (E.g. vlc - See below)
and display it locally and/or stream it over another network interface.

 cvlc v4l2:///dev/video0:chroma=mjpg:width=640:height=480 --sout '#std{access=http{mime
 =multipart/x-mixed-replace;boundary=--7b3cc56e5f51db803f790dad720ed50a},mux=mpjpeg,dst
 =127.0.0.1:8090}'

2- Goal

The initial purpose of mmstreamer project was to help me have a better understanding
of v4l2 API. It was only composed of one .c file which captured video signal from my
personal webcam and made it available to HTTP clients.

Because I think it can be useful to many people, I will make mmstreamer evolve by 
gradually adding new features taking advantage of possibilities offered by v4l2 API:

- Add support of TV tuners
- Allow to simultaneously capture from several video devices
- Add encryption to secure the data before transmission
- ...

3- License

mmstreamer is distributed under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (GPL) version 3 or later.
Please, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/> for more details.

4- Maintenance and support

I do all this on my free time without being paid or asking for any donations. Thus, bug
fixing and updates mainly depend on my availibility.

However, I will soon try to write and provide all necessary documentation so as to make
mmstreamer easier to understand.
